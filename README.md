# The Android App Market on Google Play

This is my submission to a datacamp project where I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized scraped Google Play Store data to gain insights into the Android app market. I looked at data from 10.000 apps to assess the relationship between app price, sentiment of reviews, number of installs, rating, app category, and app size (in MB).
